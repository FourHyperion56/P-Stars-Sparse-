    First, I am consiering how MAD (median of the absolute difference of each point from the median) and Chi2 relate to one another. If we see patterns across similar objects, 
    then there is likely an underlying relationship between them that we can use to classify the stars.

    We created the K-meanClustering.py program that calculates the cluster of data points across MAD and Chi2. I would like to gain a deeper understanding of the program 
    in the future. Furthermore, we see that the position of the centroids seem to have a pattern across clusters per id. May be something to look into when using a smaller
    dataset. 
1. Plot the light curve, mad--t, with mean to see how much it deviates from mean
2. Plot a histogram to see how many

For small samples, we want to start from simple models to prevent overfitting.
